<h3>Responsibilities of the Citizen...</h3><hr>
</div>
Waste prevention is perhaps more preferred to any other waste management option including recycling.Donating electronics for reuse extends the lives of valuable products and keeps them out of the waste management system for a longer time.But care should be taken while donating such items i.e. the items should be in working condition.<br>

Reuse, in addition to being an environmentally preferable alternative, also benefits society. By donating used electronics, schools, non-profit organizations, and lower-income families can afford to use equipment that they otherwise could not afford.<br>

E-wastes should never be disposed with garbage and other household wastes. This should be segregated at the site and sold or donated to various organizations.
